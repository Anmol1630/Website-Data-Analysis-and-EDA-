ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on User Engagement

* This project analyzes user engagement across different channel groups. Key steps include:

-> Data Cleaning & Preparation â€“ stripped extra spaces from column names and ensured correct data types.

-> Aggregations â€“ grouped data by Channel group to calculate total Sessions, Engaged Sessions, and derived Non-Engaged sessions.

* Visualization â€“

-> Bar plots to compare Engaged vs Non-Engaged sessions across channels.

-> Box plots to examine the distribution of Engagement rate by channel.

-> Data Reshaping â€“ used pandas.melt() to convert wide data into long/tidy format for easier plotting and comparison.
